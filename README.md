# [lihe.dev](https://www.lihe.dev)

My experimental homepage. Made with SolidStart v1. 

Work-In-Progress :construction:

Markdown support by `mdx`. Inline math support by `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.

`solid-mdx` patched for a workaround. Waiting for [PR](https://github.com/nksaraf/solid-mdx/pull/3) to be merged.
